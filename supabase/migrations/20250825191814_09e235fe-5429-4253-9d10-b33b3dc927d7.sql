-- Fix the security issue properly by creating a function that controls creator_id exposure
-- and ensure games RLS allows guest users to create games

-- First, let's fix the rooms table security properly
-- Drop current policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Room creators can view their own rooms" ON public.rooms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Room players can view basic room info" ON public.rooms;

-- Create a secure function that only exposes creator_id to the creator
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_room_safe(room_id text)

  id text,
  name text,
  difficulty difficulty_level,
  bonus_letters_enabled boolean,
  max_players integer,
  created_at timestamptz,
  updated_at timestamptz,
  creator_id text  -- Only exposed if you're the creator
